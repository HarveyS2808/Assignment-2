        <h1>Embedded CSS</h1>
        
        <p> 
            Embedded CSS is another way you can access CSS within a HTML document. Embedded CSS is typically used
            to make a single HTML file stylized in a different way to the rest of a document. Rather than being within
            a tag of a specifc object like inline CSS, Embedded CSS is declared within a style tag, in the header tag.
            These styilzations then apply to every single instance of that object in the HTML document, but are overruled
            if any inline CSS is present for individual objects.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            A practical example of embedded CSS, is that of the CSS that has been used in this document. For this example,
            I've edited the width of both these paragraphs in the style tag in the header, by only declaring it once.
            This can been seen in figure 1.

                div.desc {
                    font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;
                    font-style: oblique;
                }
        
                div.gallery {
                    border: 1px solid #ffffff;
                    width: 389px;
                    position: relative;
                }
        
            </style>

        <h2>The Pros and Cons of Embedded CSS</h2>
    
        <p style="width: 80%;">
            Embedded is very useful in creating CSS for HTML documents. Its main strength is changing
            properties for a certain type of tag, such as a paragraph or a div. 
            This is quite efficient as it removes the need for inline CSS.
            Another advantage of embedded CSS is that it removes the need for external CSS files. 
            It can also save space on external CSS files if a certain HTML page uses stylizations
            or objects that the rest of the website doesn't.
        </p>
    
        <p style="width: 80%;">
            When it comes to the disadvantages of embedded CSS, its biggest drawback is that it is limited
            to one page. This means that if you want to keep these styles throughout all the HTML pages,
            they need to be repeated in each one of them. This could then lead to an issue with the second
            disadvantage, which is the slow loading times. Because all the CSS is within the HTML file in the
            header, embedded CSS can cause slower loading times.
