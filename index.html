        <h3>CSS Box Model</h3>
        
        <p>The CSS Box Model is a structure
            which includes a few properties which help segment and design how a website is layed out. 
            These elements are the content of the website, the padding of the content, the margin of the 
            padding and finally the borders of the margins. The box model resembles how these elements are in relation to 
            one another, in the form of rectangular boxes.

        <p style="width: 90%;">
            Each element of the CSS box model has a purpose in web design, and I will
            now go over the significance of each of them.<br>
            <br>
            <span>Content</span> - The content of the CSS Box model is any detail on the website,
            such as images, text, or any other media that the client is using the web page to view.<br>
            <br>
            <span>Padding</span> - Padding in a HTML file surrounds the content of of the file,
            but is still within the border of the website. Like other components, the height and
            width can be edited. The padding is often used to expand the size of the content, without
            editing the scale of the content.<br>
            <br>
            <span>Margin</span> - The Margin section consists of the area between the border, and the margin,
            which is on the outer-most part of the diagram. The margin is used to position content in relation to the 
            edges of the tab the web page is open in. The margin can be utilized to ensure all essential content is on
            the screen at once, such as a video player.<br>
            <br>
            <span>Border</span> - The border is inbetween the margin section and the padding section of a HTML file. It is
            mostly used for wrapping the padding and content together, mostly for decorative purposes.<br>
            <br>
        </p>   
        
        <div class="BoxExample"><span>Box Model</span> (Hover to expand)</div>
        <div class="BoxContent">This text is the content section of this element. The red surrounding it
            is a padding which has extended the background colour 150 pixels in every direction from the text.
            The green border surrounding the padding and content is the border sector, This object has a left margin, so no matter
            how much the web page is scaled, it will stay 50px from the left side.
        </div>
        
        <h4>CSS Selectors</h4>
        <p class="selectors">
            CSS selections are used within CSS to highlight a certain portion of the HTML sheet and change how it looks, often done by
            selecting a certain type of class or element. However, there are many different selections which can
            let the designer set elements to selected depending on an event. These are split into 5 different types of selectors, the first 
            being simple selectors.
        </p>

        <p class="selectors">
            <a target="_blank"></a>
            <span>Simple selectors</span> - Simple selectors get their name from the fact that they operate simply
            by selecting what the element or class is, for example, a paragraph or header. For example, the "Cascading Style Sheets"
            title of this page uses a simple CSS selector to make the element animated.<br>
            <div class="gallery">
                <a target="_blank" href="simpleselect.JPG">
                    <img src="simpleselect.JPG" alt="SimpleSelectorExample" width="227" height="123">
                </a>
                <div class="desc">Figure 2 - Example of a simple selector.</div>
            </div>
        

           <p class="selectors">
            <span>Combinator selectors</span> - Combinator selectors function slightly differently from simple selectors as
            they select elements depending on how they relate to each other. An example of a combinator selector would be selecting all elements
            which are inside another certain element, or elements that follow another element. I have used a combinator selector to make all of
            the galleries within this section have red text.<br>
            <div class="gallery">
                <a target="_blank" href="comboselect.JPG">
                    <img src="comboselect.JPG" alt="CombinatorSelectorExample" width="163" height="66">
                </a>
                <div class="desc">Figure 3 - Example of a combinator selector.</div>
            </div>
        

        <p class="selectors">
            <a target="_blank"></a>
            <span>Pseudo-Class selectors</span> - Pseudo-Class selectors refer to a state of a class which is different to the usual. For example,
            This could be when a mouse is hovered over a specific element or whether a link has been visited or not. In this website, I have used
            Pseudo-Class selectors for multiple elements and states, but the best example is that of the box which expands when you hover over it. <br>
            <div class="gallery">
                <a target="_blank" href="pseudoclass.JPG">
                    <img src="pseudoclass.JPG" alt="PseudoClassSelectorExample" width="228" height="102">
                </a>
                <div class="desc">Figure 4 - Example of a pseudo-class selector.</div>
            </div>
        </p>

        <p class="selectors">
            <span>Pseudo-Elements selectors</span> - Pseudo-Elements allow you to alter a specific part of an elements within a HTML file. This can include
            certain segments of text, or content to precede or follow text, or other content of an element. This can be useful to bring attention to a specific
            reference within an element, or simply stylise a page better. For example, a Pseudo-Element selector has been used to change the first letter of each paragraph
            to a different colour and a larger size.
            <div class="gallery">
                <a target="_blank" href="pseudoelement.JPG">
                    <img src="pseudoelement.JPG" alt="PseudoElementSelectorExample" width="247" height="105">
                </a>
                <div class="desc">Figure 5 - Example of a pseudo-element selector.</div>
            </div>
        

         <p class="selectors">
         <a target="_blank"></a>
            <span>Attribute selectors</span> - Attribute selectors are quick useful as they allow the designer to select all of the elements in a HTML document with the same
            properties. This is useful for both stylisation and quickly changing a lot of different elements. In this website, I have used an attribute selector to make every other
            selector explanation in this segment change font and colour for stylisation when they are hovered over, which uses both pseudo-class and attribute selectors.
