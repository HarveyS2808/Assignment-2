<h1>Inline CSS</h1>

<p style="width: 40%;">One way of accessing CSS for a HTML website is by writing it on the same
    line as the item you want to edit, such as a paragraph or header. Inline CSS is particularly 
    useful for altering how a single object looks on a website. A practical example would be
    this paragraph as example as it has a personal width of 40%, which makes it stay to the left side of the page. 
</p>

<p style="width: 40%;">To declare inline CSS, the style should be declared within the opening
    bracket of the item, whether it be a footer or a paragraph. Figure 1 is an example of me creating
    this for these paragraphs, where I have declared their wdith as 40%.
