    <h1>Inline CSS</h1>

    <p style="width: 45%;">One way of accessing CSS for a HTML website is by writing it on the same
    line as the item you want to edit, such as a paragraph or header. Inline CSS is particularly 
    useful for altering how a single object looks on a website. A practical example would be
    this paragraph as example as it has a personal width of 40%, which makes it stay to the left side of the page. 
    </p>

    <div class="gallery">
        <a target="_blank" href="inlinecss.jpg">
            <img src="inlinecss.jpg" alt="InlineCSSExample" width="910px" height="137px">
        </a>
        <div class="desc">Figure 1 - Inline CSS in a paragraph</div>
        <style>
        
            div.desc {
            font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;
            font-style: oblique;
            }

            div.gallery {
            border: 1px solid #ffffff;
            width: 910px;
            margin: 5px;
            }

        </style>
    </div>

    <p style="width: 45%;">To declare inline CSS, the style should be declared within the opening
    bracket of the item, whether it be a footer or a paragraph. Figure 1 is an example of me creating
    this for these paragraphs, where I have declared their width as 40%. Inline CSS overrules other types
    of CSS, as it is specific to the object it is declared to.
    </p>

    <h2>The Pros and Cons of Inline CSS</h2>

    <p>
        The main advantages that the inline implementation method comes from the fact it can stylize different objects
        within the opening tag, which allows them to both differ from other objects of the same tag, and also removes the need
        for CSS on another file. This can save space, and allows for easy editing, without the risk of changing other elements.
