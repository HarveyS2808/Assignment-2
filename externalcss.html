        <p>
            External CSS involves writing characteristics for certain objects in another file,
            specifically made for CSS styling. This file is then linked to HTML documents within 
            the header tag which get their object design from the CSS File. External CSS is particularly 
            useful when a website with many HTML pages wants to use the same stylization across multiple
            pages.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            For example, external CSS is being used within this HTML page to give the footer the colours
            and transition it has. I have done this by using the class "topnav" within each HTML so I can
            alter the way it looks in all of them, which makes the code efficient and clean. Here is the code
            for making the inactive tabs red when they are hovered over.<br>
            <br>
            .topnav a:hover {<br>
                transition: 1s;<br>
                background-color: #e53838;<br>
                color: #ffffff;<br>
            }<br>
            <br>
            You can see from this that even though the code for the transition is not within this HTML file,
            it still is used as it is on the CSS page linked within the head tag.
        </p>    
    
        <h2>The Pros and Cons of External CSS</h2>
        
            <p style="width: 80%;">
                External CSS's efficiency derives from the fact it uses a seperate file to store CSS.
                In face, the biggest advantage of external CSS is the fact that the CSS can be reused
                multiple times, depending on how many HTML pages are linked to it. They also change the
                stylization of multiple tags within one line, as all objects on the HTML refer to the external
                file's CSS. This makes it very quick and efficient to stylise code, and saves a lot of space
                and loading time on the HTML pages.
            </p>
        
            <p style="width: 80%;">
                The external implementation method does not come without negatives though. As it is often used in
                multiple pages, it will need the CSS content of every object in those pages. This can make it
                difficult to change individual elements of pages, and if this is done externally those stylisations
                are also linked to other pages, which can slow down the loading times of the entire website. This
                can include the page not initially rendering correctly, and also affect the download time.
